        <div class="subheading mb-5">Human Resources Managerüë©üèª‚Äçüíº</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-year Business Administration major. I have had experience working with people to make business plans and present them in front of at least 400 people. A few things I specialize in are Psychological Structure, Business Management, and Organizational Behavior. I plan on using these skills to further my potential career in Human Resources because I love dealing with people and helping people solve their issues. I have had experience giving proper advice, wise choice-making, and directing people towards help whenever they needed it. I am often known as the school therapist due to my peers finding insight through my talks. This is also one of the reasons I am now pursuing a career in the Human Resources field.<br><br>

        I have worked at an internship at this company called Honu Square. I began as a simple Public Relationist there. In fact, back then my resume skills were pretty bad that the only reason they hired me was because my interview portion made up for my lack of satisfactory resume. I had told the interviewer about a story of myself in 5th grade. I used to run a small business in which I sold other kids at my school some cute glass animal figures. Each were 50 cents and I ended up making about $30 total at the end of the day. The interviewer felt that this story showed potential and that it was quite cute. She showed me a few of their product designs of mugs and cups. She asked if given the opportunity, what design would I make? I answered that I have a spontaneous style, so I could think up random designs that were creative and cute on the spot. Without taking even 10 seconds, I said I would design a cute cartoon shark, where the tail curved into the mug handle. She was impressed and told me I was hired on the spot. <br><br>

        Coming into UCR, I already secured myself a campus job in Campus Business Services. I was a student assistant for the distribution services of the mail station. I was in charge of mail sorting and making sure there is an accurate cost postage on every single mail before it is shipped out. It is a very important job because people's billing statements and delinquent dues are on the line. The deadline cannot be missed, as it would do the receiver a huge disfavor. This job does not get rewarded often or complimented, yet when mistakes happen, the workers are the first to blame. This really prepares me for a position in Human Resources because it involves the same treatment. People will always blame the HR person first if things go wrong, and when things go right, HR does not get much credit. This is due to the nature of humanity being more sensitive to negativty and mistakes. I have truly learned enough to be comfortable dealing with frustrated people and being able to manage the potential stress that may come my way.
